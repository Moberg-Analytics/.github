# 🧠 Neuromonitoring Analytics
Open-source tools for neurocritical care signal processing, interoperability, data visualization, and AI/ML.

Welcome to **Neuromonitoring Analytics** — an open, collaborative community building high-quality tools for multimodal signal processing, critical-care analytics, and advanced neuromonitoring research.

Our mission is to **accelerate innovation in brain monitoring and critical care** by creating open-source utilities, algorithms, and frameworks that clinicians, researchers, and engineers can use, extend, and improve.

Whether you’re working with EEG, ICP, ABP, rCBF, NIRS, or other physiologic data streams, this community brings together the people and tools needed to make sense of complex signals.

## 🌟 What We Build

We maintain open-source resources across the neuromonitoring and critical-care analytics ecosystem, including:

* **Signal processing utilities**
Tools for EEG spectral analysis, ICP/CPP/PRx computation, waveform manipulation, filtering, and artifact detection.

* **Data structures & interoperability libraries**
Converters for EDF, CSV, HDF5, and clinical monitor exports; harmonization utilities; multimodal alignment helpers.

* **Event detection & physiologic insights**
Algorithms to identify ICP crises, autonomic patterns, circulatory responses, cerebral autoregulation behavior, and time-linked physiologic events.

* **Visualization templates**
Plotly-based dashboards, waveform browsers, trend explorers, and analytics notebooks.

* **Example notebooks & research workflows**
Ready-to-run Jupyter notebooks for common neuromonitoring tasks.

Our tooling spans clinical research, device development, ICU analytics, and data science — and everything we build is meant to be extensible and community-driven.

## 🤝 How to Get Involved

We welcome contributors from all backgrounds:
* Neurointensivists
* Neuroscientists
* Data scientists
* Biomedical engineers
* Software developers
* Neurocritical care fellows
* Students & trainees

Ways to participate:
* Create or comment on GitHub Issues
* Contribute code or examples
* Propose new features

**No contribution is too small.**

## 💬 Join the Discord Community

Our Discord server is the real-time home of the community.

👉 **Join here:** https://neuromonitoring.com/discord

Chat with maintainers, collaborators, and users building neuromonitoring tools across ICUs, labs, and research groups worldwide.

## 📚 Repositories

This organization hosts multiple repositories, including:
* **data-converters** — tools for EDF/HDF5/CSV/monitor-specific conversions
* **neuromonitoring-toolkit** — core signal processing & analytics utilities
* **clinical-notebooks** — curated Jupyter notebooks for handling ICU physiologic data

Additional repos are added as new tools mature.

## 🗺 Roadmap

Our upcoming community goals:
* Build a shared open-source framework for multimodal physiologic analysis
* Standardize multimodal signal processing feature extraction pipelines
* Provide robust event detection libraries for critical care research
* Publish high-quality example workflows and teaching materials
* Enable interoperability across physiologic data formats and systems
* Develop APIs for real-time or near-real-time use cases
* Integrate into bedside systems for research

Have ideas for the roadmap? Propose them in Issues or on Discord.

## 🔬 Our Philosophy

We believe neuromonitoring analytics should be:
* **Open** — transparent algorithms and reproducible processing
* **Clinical-grade** — accuracy, clarity, and rigor
* **Collaborative** — built with clinicians, researchers, and engineers
* **Extensible** — modular tools that accelerate innovation

By combining clinical insight with shared tooling, we can dramatically improve how physiologic data is interpreted and used.
